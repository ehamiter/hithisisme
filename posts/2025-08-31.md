# lumberjack suburbia

i was running down the street
slow, but fast enough to call it running
and i saw two guys
one was filming the other guy
the guy being filmed was cutting down a tree
they paused as i ran past them
i looked at them
they looked at me
i gave them a double thumbs up and smiled
they smiled back and gave me two single thumbs up
since the other single thumbs were holding a phone and a chainsaw
i kept running
they kept filming and chainsawing
i heard a crack
i turned around and kept running backwards
the tree fell
they gave me a thumbs up
i thumbs upped them back
i turned around and kept running
